        <h3>Carryover from last meeting</h3>
        <p>This is the first convening of the Council of Elrond. <strong>There were no previous meetings where tasks were carried over.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <section id="discussion">
        <h3>Discussion of Agenda Items</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Gandalf narrated his experience</strong> with the Ring and fire, and uttered the black speech inscribed on The Ring, to the displeasure of Elrond. This dispelled doubts of its veracity.</li>
          <li>The Ring was <strong>decided to be destroyed</strong>, as it would corrupt all those who used it. If one was uncorruptable, it was agreed that the Nazgul would hunt them down. Thus, it needs to be destroyed in the <strong>heart of Mount Doom.</strong></li>
          <li>Bilbo proposed that he take the Ring, as did various others. However, internal politics between races led to no unanimous answer. <strong>Frodo suggested that he take the Ring</strong>, and many pledged their allegiance to him.</li>
          <li>Various eavesdropping Hobbits (listed in the attendance) appeared out of the shadows, decided that they too would join the Fellowship formed. </li>
          <li>Fellowship consists of Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>General post-meeting concerns </h3>
        <p>
          There appears to be friction between Legolas and Gimli: both are working in favor of opposing factions of Middle Earth. <br> 
          Boromir may be a threat to the company: he seems determined to obtain the Ring for Gondor, rather than working towards destroying it.
